np
Todo for search: 
-> Show "No results message" DONE
        --> What's the optimal way to actually do it?
-> Show loading button 
-> If input is empty, go back to discover
--> min x number of votes
--> Go back to 'discovery' if there is no search term;
--> keyword is required and year is optional --> 


Genre filter: 
--> Make it collapsible


Setting up testing: 


--> Disable babel transpilation in parcel:
        -> https://parceljs.org/languages/javascript/#usage-with-other-tools

--> Set up babel/jest config
        -> https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html#function-and-class-components


--> Integrate jest with react testing library
https://dev.to/yvad60/setup-jest-and-react-testing-library-in-a-react-project-a-step-by-step-guide-1mf0


--> Integrate jest with Eslint


--> difference in testing class / function components


MSW:
--> Must contain at least one test 
--> Redundant use of query parameters
        -> Match against a path
        -> Access query parametrs in the response resolve using req.url.searchParams



Filters for language: 
original_language: "en", "fr", "de", "it"

Filters for scoring: 
vote_average


Todos: 



SearchBar: 
-> Refactor 'No results'
        --> Aligned but needs additional design

SideBar: 
-> Fix colors on the SideBar 

Search/Filter Bar:
        --> Language is hardcoded

Lists: 
--> Add 0 results 
--> Fix the buttons 

Fetcher: 

General: 
-> Fix folder structure

Questions: 
--> Optimise the lists set up
--> Debouncing: 
        -> Interaction with the loading state
        -> images loading 
--> State for filters

SearchResults refactor: 
--> single movies state with 2 new properties:
        -> Watched: boolean 
        -> Saved: boolean 

SearchBar + Filters ideas:
--> Fix year keyword when length > 4

--> Refactor JSX in SearchBar



Lists: 
--> Optimise the structure
--> Make sure the buttons work
        
    
--> Fix size of No Results hae been found: marging, width



Problems:
--> Overlay disappears when clicking the button 
--> Sometimes the Watch Later button returns undefined actionType
--> Lists are still weirdly created

Refactoring: 
--> MovieItem could do with some
