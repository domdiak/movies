TOdos:
--> Look into setting up .env DONE 
--> Add additional folders inside components folder
--> move filters into discover component (because of mobile) DONE
--> Combine Search bar and Filter Menu together as well DONE
--> Add scss file with global styles // or styled components global styles

MovieItem: 
--> Rating: borderradius, font-color, background-color, font boldness, set height, padding DONE
--> Genres: smaller font, diferent color DONE
--> Image: ratio DONE
--> spacing if text is DONE
--> Add no image available 
np
Todo for search: 
-> Show "No results message" DONE
        --> What's the optimal way to actually do it?
-> Show loading button 
-> If input is empty, go back to discover
--> min x number of votes
--> Go back to 'discovery' if there is no search term;
--> keyword is required and year is optional --> 


Genre filter: 
--> Make it collapsible


Setting up testing: 


--> Disable babel transpilation in parcel:
        -> https://parceljs.org/languages/javascript/#usage-with-other-tools

--> Set up babel/jest config
        -> https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html#function-and-class-components


--> Integrate jest with react testing library
https://dev.to/yvad60/setup-jest-and-react-testing-library-in-a-react-project-a-step-by-step-guide-1mf0


--> Integrate jest with Eslint


--> difference in testing class / function components


MSW:
--> Must contain at least one test 
--> Redundant use of query parameters
        -> Match against a path
        -> Access query parametrs in the response resolve using req.url.searchParams


Implementing filter function: 
--> create a new component with the filters DONE
--> getting genreIds => moviesData.results[0].genre_ids => returns an array DONE
--> filter the display function based on genreids DONE
--> Fixed hardCoded checkedState in FiltermMenu DONE
--> created checkedState for eachbox DONE 
--> fix state on Line 35 in Filter Menu as it doesn't update
--> implement filter function which doesn't affect state

Issues: 
filterResults function feeds filtered genreIds into SearchResults
        --> created a state just to hold this data
makes it difficult to re-use filterResults to filter MovieItem components 
try start with filter and then go into map]
